# CRAFT BEER AND BREWERIES STUDY
Final Presentation of Craft Breweries and Beers 
## AUTHORS : PEARLY PAUL AND KEVIN ALBRIGHT
## INTRODUCTION
In the below report,We have been provided two data sets for various `beers` and the `breweries` that produce them in the US.
Our team had to do an exploratory Data Analysis on the data provided to come up with useful insights.
We were provided with two separate data sets, one with details of the beers and and the other with the details of the breweries around the USA.

## DATASETS USED AND PROVIDED FOR ANALYSIS :
  - **[/dataset/Beers.csv](/dataset/Beers.csv)** : This dataset was provided by our clients of Craft Beer. This dataset contains the details of all the beers made by Craft breweries in US.  
  - **[/dataset/Breweries.csv](/dataset/Breweries.csv)** : This dataset was provided by our clients of Craft Beer. This dataset contains the details of all the  Craft breweries in US.  
  - **[/dataset/Beers_and_Breweries_merged.csv](/dataset/Beers_and_Breweries_merged.csv)** : As part of the EDA we merged the Beers and Breweries dataset to analyze the beers made in every States
  - **[/dataset/Craft_Beer_Breweries_merged_Cleaned.csv](https://github.com/pearlypaul2712/Craft-Beer-and-Breweries-Study/blob/9f745ddb1af6e570dc19426ac069c2cf8c75039a/dataset/Craft_Beer_Breweries_merged_Cleaned.csv)** : This dataset contains the merged dataset Beer and Breweries .Since the merged dataset contains missing ABV and IBU values. Hence to avoid this bias of missing values to impact our analysis we did replaced the missing values with the respective means of respective regions.
  - **[/dataset/Region_State.csv](/dataset/Region_State.csv)** : As part of our analsysis we created this dataset to group the States by region to come up with valuable insights.
